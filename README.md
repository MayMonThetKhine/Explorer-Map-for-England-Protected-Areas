# Map Explorer of England Protected Areas
## Overview
This project aims to address the problem of limited public awareness by building an interactive web mapping application, “Map Explorer of England Protected Areas”. Open Government data from Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) accessed through its Data Services Platform and web-GIS tools are used to create a client-side map that visualises England’s protected areas and educates users about the areas’ distribution and designation.

## Technical Architecture
The web application is implemented entirely on client side using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Leaflet is leveraged as the mapping library since it is lightweight, and open-source. The site is hosted using Netlify, a development platform for web application deployments. The overall stack as shown in the figure – HTML, CSS, JS + Leaflet + OSM tiles + Nominatim + Netlify – shows the use of open-source tools and data for web-based GIS.
